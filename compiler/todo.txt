for this week:
- factor code out for generating temp vars
- assignment expressions where the RHS is a function call
- remove all the functions which do a switch on the tree code and put the 
  functionality into a new virtual function in CTreeNode
- boolean expressions as function call parameters


optimisations:
- modify if lowering to only require one jump if we haven't got an else
- optimise if() with constant parameters
- eliminate stores to a var by itself during MIR lowering eg. a = a 
- modify "if..else" statement lowering so that the else block follows the
  compare so we only need one jump instead of two
- dont clear out the symbol table after parsing, instead only add decls
  for compiler generated temporaries
- optimise array access handling if the index is a literal
